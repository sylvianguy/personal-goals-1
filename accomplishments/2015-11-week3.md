__Week in Review__

It's been... several weeks. Picking this back up, because it feels like life is a little off the rails, 
and I need a semblance of routine. It's going to be an intense week - I have 4 technical phone interviews
scheduled, and two more that will hopefully come through. I need to stay very strong, mentally, and a big 
part of succeeding there is going to the gym, eating well, and sleeping enough. And getting all the bullshit
out of my system by writing. Feeling hopeful and optimistic about it going well. Let's see where I'm at a 
week from now.
