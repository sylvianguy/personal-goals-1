__Week in Review__

This week was pretty tough. I felt less than satisfied with my understanding of concepts at the end of all three sprints, and I was unable to make time to go back and review concepts from them over the weekend. However, it was a better week than the last in terms of maintaining my routine, which I managed to do successfully this week. Still a bit disorganized in the mornings, and skipped breakfast some days, but wasn't ever late. Next week, I'm going to focus on having a more organized diet, and on catching up with all of the things that I feel unsure about right now.
